  extrovert:
    "In public and at work you are a ball of energy perpetually on the move. You take the initiative, encourage others, hate waiting and are endlessly anticipating what’s going on around you. You take real pleasure in managing everything, much like the conductor of an orchestra. You enjoy being noticed by your work peers and your anxiety is linked more to the thought of leaving others indifferent. You need other’s attention to fully exist, but once you’ve crossed the threshold of your home, it’s another matter. You no longer take initiatives, but leave others to decide in your place. When your partner asks you to make a choice or give an opinion about holiday destinations, dinner menus or the children’s activities, you offer little or no input. You’re not comfortable and don’t know how to react and those around you often interpret your passiveness as a lack of interest or a certain reticence. The reactions of those around you may make you feel the need to revise your behaviour to close the gap between the two poles of your life. People feel that you compensate in one area of life (public), which you have trouble handling on the other side (private). The public over-activity into which you throw yourself prevents you from expressing your emotions and feelings. At work, rationality and efficiency is asked of you, but even there, emotions and feelings are unavoidable. It’s not by denying or pushing them out of your attention that they cease to exist. Instead, by forcing them out of your conscious mind, they govern you unconsciously. Why are you so afraid of your emotions? What are you afraid of finding deep within yourself? This over-investment in public and professional life could well be, to a certain degree, running away from whatever it is that you don’t master or control. You’d win some inner serenity if you accepted to walk the road of self-knowledge.",
  introvert:
    "You feel that living alone is to live happily, and you prefer hiding in a crowd rather than standing out in one. You are perpetually tormented by the idea of doing things wrong, not understanding or not being alert enough or intelligent enough to do what others expect of you. You lack in self-confidence and you seem to believe that others are better than you. While in a conversation, for example, you would be more likely to go along with the other’s points of view as you don’t fully respect your own opinions. Where there’s a low level task to complete or a service to be allotted, it’s you who volunteers. When people want to get out of a task, they naturally come to you as they know that you never say ‘no’. It’s not surprising that you sometimes have the impression of being permanently exploited, but you don’t really know how to break this vicious circle. On the rare occasions that you’ve tried to do so, this uncharacteristic defiance has caused uproar and you’ve ended up backing down. You are afraid of contact with others as you imagine that they are constantly judging you and that their probing looks will obviously find your faults. So, you try to remain the most transparent and discreet possible. How far will you take this logic of self-denigration? Try and stop projecting onto others the bad image you have about yourself. Have a good look around you and you’ll see that they too have faults, weaknesses and shortcomings, so stop finding excuses for everything. Maybe you were brought up in an atmosphere of ‘You’ll never make the grade’ as a child — a poison that you need progressively to get out of your system. Learn to look after your own interests — everyone else does, so why not you? You too have desires, dreams and opinions — express them. If you think that by saying no or thinking differently from others that you will no longer be loved, it just isn’t so. Others will learn to respect you because you respect yourself.",
